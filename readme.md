# Go Cache

This is an open source, distributed key-value database for caching. It's specifically for
new Gophers/programmers to learn about Go and caching. This project is inspired by [GeekTutu](https://geektutu.com/post/geecache.html)'s project to new Gophers about caching. You can click on the link to learn about their projects. In this project, I will follow their
guides and make incremental commits.
